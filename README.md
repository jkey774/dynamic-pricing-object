# dynamic-pricing-object

A JavaScript component that displays the base monthly rental rate by available product line.

This just loops through the global JavaScript object object on the page named 'digitalData', which was populated sever-side, and passes values to the front-end component for rendering according to business logic.

The code inside index.js was part of a prototype written in pure JavaScript by necessity and the strings of html markup inside the JavaScript were a result of the constraint.
